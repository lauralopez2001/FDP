# Characterization of the diurnal eating patterns and of their effect on obesity in the Italian population

On this repository you can find all the code used to perform the analysis and pre-processing for my Final Degree Project 


The folder "Pre-processing and data preparation" has the code used to correct, pre-process and prepare the survey data

Folder "Analisy" has all the code used to do the analysis both in R and in stata, the folder has two folders one with the process of the first dichotomization of the variables and one with the second "quicker" analysis done with the alternative dichotomization.
Files outside the folder are the first analysis that is performed before dichotomization

### Survey Data

The survey can be downloaded at Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO](https://www.fao.org/gift-individual-food-consumption/data/en) by accessing the Italian survey
